# Project Overview
This project simulates job scheduling across multiple server groups within a network system. It models the arrival and service processes, handles events like job arrivals and departures, and calculates metrics such as mean response time. The simulation can run in either trace mode or random mode, providing flexibility in testing different scenarios.
